        1. prompt the user for two hexadecimal values and perform the necessary validation and
           conversion in order to display the result of their addition.

        2. Quit option will display a goodbye message and end the program

This was originally a college project that had to fallow a strict brief with regards to coding standards and formatting. Once it was finished I decided to adapt the code and play about with it myself, splitting out the JavaScript from the HTML file into a separate, external stylesheet and add some styling with CSS, as well as updating the Javascript to ES6.
